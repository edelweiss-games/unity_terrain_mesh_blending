Experimental terrain mesh blending for Unity3d
==============================================

This is my own research project for evaluating a simple mesh terrain blending solution for Unity3d.
It's based on generating a dynamic heightmap from the terrain surrounding the player and then using this information to average the actual mesh normals together.

Feel free to use this a starting point for your own Unity3d projects.
